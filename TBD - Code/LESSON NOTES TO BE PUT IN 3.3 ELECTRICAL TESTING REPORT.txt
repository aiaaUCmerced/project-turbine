Arduino Lesson Notes so Far

Lesson 0:IDE Installation

Install Latest Version from Arduino Website


Download nessecary libraries from Box [ 3.0 Systems > 3.3 Systems Test > Elegoo 37 Sensory Kit Tutorial ]

------
NOTE: Dallas Humidity Temprature (DHT) Library is out of date and you will need to install the following libraries:

DHT Sensors Non-Blocking [1.0.4 as of writing this document may update]
DHT KXN
DHT Sensor Library
------------

NOTE #2: WHEN SETTING UP ARDUINO ONCE CONNECTED: MAKE SURE THAT THE BAUD RATE OF THE SERIAL MONITOR MATCHES BAUD RATE OF PROGRAM (
E.I. Serial.begin(9600); ---->  SCREENSHOT OF BAUD RATE HERE	  )




Lesson 1:Library Setup

Noted that documentation does not have current libraries



Lesson 2: Dallas Humidity and Temprature Sensor (DHT11)










Lesson 7: Sensor Switches

Notes: Had to adjust code for visible results with SHOCK SWITCH, seems that "HIGH" output occurs when sensor is not triggered.
Seems to also be true for TILT SWITCH.



Lesson 8L IR Reciever and Transmitter

Make sure the Arduino IDE has IRremote Version 2.6.0, as any newer versions will have complications.
